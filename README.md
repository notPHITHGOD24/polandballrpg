## Getting the game and run the game

Head over [releases](https://github.com/notPHITHGOD24/polandballrpg/releases) and find the latest version of
PolandballRPG+.
There, you can find an file called `polandball.exe`. Click the file, and after you have downloaded the file, you
must double-click the file in downloads folder to open it.
You must first confirm that you have [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) (at least version 8) installed on your
computer.

## How to build/run in development

Because this project uses a build tool called gradle it is very easy to build or run the project from the source code.

1. Download the source code by clicking the green code button, and download it as a ZIP.
2. Extract the contents of the folder.
3. Open command prompt and enter `cd <folder_location>`, this will open the folder in the command prompt.
4. Type `gradlew run` or `gradlew build` to run or build the program. This might take some time. If on unix, add "./" to
   the front. If on Windows using an IDE or Windows Powershell, add ".\" to the front.
    1. If you built the project, the jar file is found in `build/libs`
    2. If you get an error screaming that you're missing java. You need
       to [set up](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/setting-the-java_home-variable-in-windows-8895.html) your
       JAVA_HOME environment variable, or download a JDK if you haven't already.
